# cypress-example

This project contains example on including Cypress with actual client project.

Currently, it shows a simple layout testing example to verify, that the application should include an App bar, which should be positioned at the top of the view, be of full width, and height of 36px.


## Usage

1. On one terminal, start the local dev server for the `demo-app` by running `npm run demo-app:open`
2. On second termina, start the Cypress server by running `npm run cypress:open`
3. Both servers use hot-reloading, go on and start hacking!
